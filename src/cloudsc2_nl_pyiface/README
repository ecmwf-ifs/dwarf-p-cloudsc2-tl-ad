This is an intermediate solution on how to execute IFS physics when driven from Fortran.

Known problems:
- CMake does not copy Python files to build/bin/pythonexec if Fortran files are unchanged
- cloudsc2_inputs.py and cloudsc2_driver.py should be trimmed, currently only loading reference fields is needed from their functionality. Everything else is now in cloudsc2_data and reference files should be probably managed there as well.
- In cloudsc2_data it seems to make sense to declare list of input/output variables in global dictionaries, rather than declaring them locally in each method
